// print currrent state of circuit----stage of The participants interaction and inputs
##
print (list of the topics and corresponding state ie topic:state)
##
print message(Given the state of the system use the gates provided to manipulate the circuit so as to maximise the probability of finding your desired state)
##
Prompt for adding the gates(also print the list of available gates)
##
Take the participants gates in form (Circuit2="save it here")
##

------Selection of topic
Act out Circuit 2
##
Get the results(in form 00,01,10,11)
##
save results in variable eg t = 01
##
If t==00 print (topic 1)
elif t==01 print (topic 2)
elif t==10 print (topic 3)
else print (topic 4)

-------selection of Question
if t==00 {
    //we will have to figure out a function(t) such that we can produce the question by just giving the value of t 

     the questions are represented by 00,01,10,11 so we need a circuit with H(q0)and H(q1)
     ##
     measure the circuit
     ##
     the answer you get{00/01/10/11}
     let's put this answer in a variable-v
     ##
     if v==00 print (Topic 1 Question 1)
     elif v==01 print (Topic 1 question 2)
     elif v==10 print (Topic 1 question3)
     else print (Topic 1 question4)

}
