## ABSTRACT
We can hear people cheering aloud as the high school quiz team contest for a National level trophy. As a member of the team you wish to win as many points as possible. After the cuthroat rounds here comes the round where your Quantum Computing Knowledge comes to your aid.In this round you are given 4 topics,one topic is the field of your expertise.
You badly wish that your team gets this topic,however the possibility of getting the topic is not random. These topics are in a superposition in a 2 qubit system.Each topic represent a possible outcome of measuring the superposition -AND THAT OUTCOME is the topic for your team. You are super excited as you are told that applying some gates you will be able to manipulate the current state of the system so as to maximise the probability of finding your target topic.

## HOW TO PLAY
1. Participants begin with choosing the number of rounds.(In the case of a Quiz though this number would be decided by the organisers)
2. The list of Topics will be displayed with the corresponding state.
3. The initial state of the circuit will be displayed. It will be an arbitary state and participants can use upto 3 gates(x,y,t,) to manipulate this initial state inorder to   maximise the probability of finding their desired topic.
4. The state of the modified circuit will be displayed and measurement executed.
5. Once the job is executed you will get your topic! (This is the time to rejoy if you had applied the right gates as you get the topic of your expertise, if you failed to apply the right gates...Good Luck with another topic.You can also be clever and create a superposition between 2 topics : one of your expertise and other your second preferance.)
6. Once you get a topic you will have to answer a question that will be randomly selected related to the topic.
7. A correct answer will add a point to your team's scoreboard and a wrong one will result in a negative marking.
8. The game will loop depending on the number of rounds.

## HOW HIGH IS THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING QUANTUMNESS IN THIS GAME?
While a general quiz is absolutely random or the players can manually select a topic, adding the properties of gate operations not only add a superposition of predictability and randomness to the game but also makes the players develop a need to learn about gate operations and probability amplitude and creating curiosity in the minds of the viewers.Here the topic until selected is in a superposition of all topics.
