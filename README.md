## ABSTRACT
We can hear people cheering aloud as the high school quiz team contest for a national level trophy. As a member of the team you wish to win as many points as possible. After the cut-throat rounds with rivals, here comes the round where your quantum computing knowledge comes to your aid. In this round you are given 4 topics, in which one topic is the field of your expertise.
As such, you you really want your team to get this topic. However, unlike a Classical Quiz, the possibility of getting the topic is not completely random. These topics are in a superposition in a 2 qubit system. Each topic represents a possible outcome of measuring the superposition, where the outcome is the topic for your team. You are super excited, as you are told that by applying some gates you will be able to manipulate the current state of the system so as to maximise the probability of selecting your desired topic.

## HOW TO PLAY
1. Participants begin with choosing the number of rounds.(In the case of a Quiz this number would be decided by the organisers)
2. The list of topics will be displayed with the corresponding state.
3. The initial state of the circuit will be displayed. It will be an arbitary state, and participants can use up to 3 gates to manipulate this initial state in order to maximize the probability of picking their desired topic.
4. The state of the modified circuit will be displayed and measured.
5. Once the job is executed, you will get your topic! (This is the time to rejoice if you had applied the right gates, as you will most likely get the topic of your expertise. If you failed to apply the right gates...Good Luck with the other topic. You can also be clever and create a superposition between 2 topics: one of your expertise and the other, your second preferance.)
6. Once you get a topic you will have to answer a question that will be randomly selected related to the topic.
7. A correct answer will add a point to your team's scoreboard, and a wrong one will result in a negative marking.
8. The game will loop depending on the number of rounds chosen at the start of the game.

## HOW HIGH IS THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING QUANTUMNESS IN THIS GAME?
While a classical quiz can be absolutely random or definite (in the case that the players can manually select a topic), adding the properties of gate operations not only adds a superposition of predictability and randomness to the game. These quantum properties make the players develop a need to learn about gate operations and probability amplitude, in order to best manipulate their chances at winning. It also stimulates curiosity in the minds of the viewers about this wierd thing called "superposition." In this game, the topic is in a superposition of all topics until selected.
